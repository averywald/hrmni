# HRMNI
### The What
HRMNI is an inkling of an idea for a Spotify extension app that can hopefully help people connect through the universal language: Music.
### The Why
Music was nearly my first love.  It inspires me and fills a void in my life, as it does for many others.  I listen to music most days - most hours - and usually I'm on a device.  So, I decided to try out a few music apps (you know which ones), and Spotify reigns supreme for me for a few reasons:
- They play outside the walls of the Apple stronghold
- Their brand is sleek and innovative
- Collaborative playlists
- Party sessions
- More robust and prominent user exposure

The last point brings me to the crux of this whole deal.  One of the best things about music is that it's inherently subjective, and finding common ground with others that share your impeccable taste is awesome.  I really like adding friends and folks with great playlists, and seeing what they're listening to on the desktop version of Spotify.  You can dive into their life a little bit from there; I find it very grounding.  Often I wish that I could leave a comment, or a like on their current rotation.  So, I am setting out to build a platform that lets me do just that.  After all, isn't what the world needs most another form of social media? :)
